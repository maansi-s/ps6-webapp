The dataset used for this project is intended to help travelers book their ideal AirBnb when visiting the greater Seattle area. Information is given about pricings, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, ratings, location, and more.

In this app, users may select how many people they are traveling with in order to find AirBnbs that can fit
everyone in their party, and they can view which areas to search the most in according to how many AirBnb openings
show up on the scatterplot. This can save time during their search for housing because users will know which cities to spend the mosting time AirBnb-searching in. 

They can adjust the maximum amount of openings they'd like to see on the graph at a time using the slider and they can select what their party size is (the number of people staying in the AirBnb) by selecting one the possible options in the radio buttons.
